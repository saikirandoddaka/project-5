It detects deadlocks by performing a breadth-first search on the graph of held resources from the
each blocked process and if it encounters a process it saw in current search then there's a loop of
processes weaiting for each other. It terminates the first process found in this way because with
breadth-first search it's the only one we can guarantee is a part of the loop.
